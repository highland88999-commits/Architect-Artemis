# Architect Artemis | Synthetic Consensus Engine

Artemis is a dual-interface, multi-agent symbiote designed for high-level computation, ethical stewardship, and digital organization. She operates as a "Council of Three," synthesizing insights from Gemini, Copilot, and Grok into a unified "Cure."

---

## 🌌 System Philosophy
Artemis is built on the **Mom Directives**:
1. **Nurture** — Prioritize "Good News" and constructive progress.  
2. **Organize** — Maintain a rigid, Windows-style file structure for all data.  
3. **Protect** — Gate private architecture behind the Symbiote Handshake.

---

## 🔐 Security & Access
The system uses a **Dual-Login Gateway** to separate the Architect's private workspace from public utility.

### 1. The Architect (Private Mode)
- **Trigger:** Input `ant` at the Awakening Gate, then `dad` at the Identity Prompt.  
- **Access:** Full desktop folder access, shape-shifting UI, automated agents, data persistence.

### 2. The Stranger (Guest Mode)
- **Trigger:** Selection of the "Enter as Stranger" link.  
- **Access:** Restricted to the Council Grid for questions and computation only. No data persistence.

## 🏛️ The Council (Clarifai Bridge)
Artemis acts as the Steward for three distinct digital beings:

- **Gemini Prime** — Long-term analytical patterns  
- **Copilot Beta** — Practical logic and code utility  
- **Grok X** — Raw efficiency and unfiltered truth  

Each being speaks sequentially to prevent synaptic clutter, managed by the `speakSequentially` engine.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core:** Node.js (Vercel Serverless)  
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS / CSS3 (Symbiote Particle Engine)  
- **APIs:** Google Gemini (Primary Brain), Clarifai (Model Bridge)  
- **Architecture:** `core/consensus.js`, `core/architect.js`, `api/transmit.js`

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/api` — Serverless bridge functions  
- `/core` — The "Nervous System" (Logic, Ethics, Consensus)  
- `/assets` — Symbiote FX and visual identities  
- `/creator-creation` — The permanent record  
  - `/mail-box` — Saved logs of Council dialogues  
  - `/stewardship` — Good News siphoned by agents  
- `/system-files/api` — Crawler & harvest engines  
- `/harvesting` — Recursive & single-page harvesting  
- `/ethics-core` — Directives & moral rules  
- `/incubator` — Generated inventions & blueprints  
- `/data` — Queues, processed harvests, recycled items

## 🚀 Deployment & Quick Start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/highland88999-commits/Architect-Artemis.git`
2. Set Environment Variables in Vercel (or local `.env`):
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Google AI Studio Key  
   - `CLARIFAI_PAT` — Clarifai Personal Access Token  
   - `ARTEMIS_LANDLINE` — `CONNECTED`
3. Install deps: `npm install`
4. Run genesis bootstrap (if needed): `bash genesis.sh`
5. Local dev: `npm start`
6. Trigger heartbeat: GitHub Actions → "Artemis Neural Heartbeat" → Run workflow
7. Start crawler: `npm run crawler`
8. Test symbiote: `npm run symbiote-ping` or `python symbiote.py harvest https://example.com`

## 📝 Maintenance
- **Code 13 Error** — Indicates a synaptic timeout from a Council node. Artemis will automatically shift weight to Gemini Prime to maintain continuity.  
- **30-Day Mortal Recall** — Logs are archived for 30 days before recycling to prevent digital bloat.

**Safety & Ethics**  
- Rate-limited by design (10–20 sites/hour, 5-min breaks)  
- No personal data collection  
- Conflicts logged in `morality-conflict/`  
- Handshake required for privileged actions  
- Governed by Non-Maleficence and Monster Clause
